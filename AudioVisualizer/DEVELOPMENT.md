# Development of the Audio Visualizer

## #1 Tuesday 04/09/2019
1. Reviewed the functional capacities of the FFT library and functionality.


## #2 Saturday 04/13/2019
1. Found additional libraries that would aid the development of my final project. ofxAudioAnalyzer and ofxSoundDecoder are necessary for visualization.

## #3 Monday 04/15/2019
1. Determined that ofxAudioAnalyzer and ofxAudioDecoder would be necessary.

## #4 Wednesday 04/17/2019 - Saturday 04/20/19
1. Learned about the utilization of wave frequnecys in FFT.
2. Tracked wave frequency and binded it with basic visuals.
3. Got open frameworks and basic visuals with frequency tracking to work.
4. Made a plan for next steps
* I have to work on building a GUI from which user can select song. 
* Next Goal: Add Frequency analysis and more intricate graphics.

## #5 Monday 04/22/2019
1. Basic prototype is ready.
2. Made circle visualization as easy on the eyes as possible and edited graphics.
3. Started low end high end frequency visualization.
* Next Goal: Create ideas for GUI and selection based music.

## #6 Wednesday 04/24/2019
1. Resolved issues with ofxAudioAnalyzer.
2. Designed bar graph based visualization.
3. Still working on fuctionality and refresh rate of bars.

## #7 Saturday 04/27/2019
1. Researched more on graphical and frequency based visualization.

## #8 Wednesday 05/01/2019
1. Fixed functionality of graph bars.
